    <p class = "smallbox">Having your bike break down sucks. Having to over-pay at most bike shops
    sucks even more. When you need to pay for services that cost almost as
    much as the bike itself, there's a serious problem.</p>

    <h2 class = "solution">The solution? Anteater Bike Care!</h2>
    <p class = "smallbox">I will not only match the price of any bike shop, but also cut their rate
    in half. You'll be back riding faster than ever! Please go to the <a href = "services.html">Services</a>
